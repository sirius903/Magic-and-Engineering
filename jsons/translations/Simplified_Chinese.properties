Mighty Sargon the Great of Akkad, we prostrate ourselves before you! You are the Emperor of the Akkadians, the greatest people to ever arise along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. From its founding around 2300 BCE, Akkad spread its dominion through a force like none of which the ancient world had ever seen, which marked, among other things, history's first standing army. Ranging from the Tarsus Mountsins to the Persian Gulf, the mighty Akkadian empire was a force to be reckoned with. Yet, you were much better than a mere warmonger, because your rule oversaw the flourishing of trade cross all of the Middle East, extending all the way to the cities of Greece. Although the curses of war and famine tore your kingdom apart after centuries of prosperity, Mesopotamia was once again transformed into a land of culture and color as the ever-growing wealth of Akkad heralded a time of peace in the forever restless realm. =

Salutations, Eva Perón, spiritual leader of the Argentinian nation and wife to Juan Perón. Yours is the second largest country in Latin America, and its name has derived from the rumors of the existence of silver mountains; what is certainly rich is history in both pre-columbian and republican eras. With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat deal with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of their European roots, they deeply linked the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; and because of their condition of colonials, they link themselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies the people, feeling somehow the vocation of the Patria Grande San Martín and Bolívar once imagined. =

Welcome, O magnificent and enlightened King Tiridates III, descendant of the great and ancient Kingship of Armenia. Your country's history stretches far back, its origins tracing from the northernmost satrapies of the mighty Achaemenid Dynasty. For centuries, the Kingdom lay at the crossroads of power, between the two empires of Rome in the West and Parthinia in the East, who would wage bloody war for the right to subjugate her beneath them. In the 3rd century AD, the throne of Armenian Kings would fall to the occupation of the Sassanid Persians, successors of Parthia, but, with the aid of the Roman Emperor Aurelian, it would be restored unto you, Armenia's rightful King. And as her King, you would go on to proclaim Armenia's devotion as the first Christian state in the world, several dozen years prior the proclamation of Constantine the Great. =

Greetings, most wise and prudent Henry Parker, father of the Australian Federation. Australia truly is a unique and ancient land, more so than any other, for its lands abound in nature's gifts and its shores have beckoned, welcomed, and harbored immigrants from afar for over 50,000 years. By the time you arrived in Sydney as an English immigrant in 1839, Australia was divided into thriving British colonies of undeniably vital significance. By 1889, as premier you had led the colony of New South Wales five times to achieve many great things that undoubtedly improved the lives of many. You will always be remembered, however, in the hearts of Australians, for being instrumental in the process of federating the Australian colonies into a single united nation, earning you the humble title of "The father of the Australian Federation". Thanks to your efforts, Australia today remains one of the most wealthy, prosperous, and modern countries in the developed world, and truly a sight to behold. =

Peace and blessings be upon you, oh great Saladin! From humble beginnings in a Kurdish family, your upbringing in Damascus saw you excel in all which you took part in. It was under your leadership that combined Muslim armies defeated the ambitious Crusaders of Europe in a series of victories in which you overcame overwhelming odds in order to prevail. None could stand against you, and your forces became pivotal in driving the Christians out of the Holy Land once more. From your stronghold of Cairo, you established the Ayyubid dynasty, one which would come to rule vast swathes of land, from Tunisia in the west to Mesopotamia in the East and Nubia in the South. Despite your overwhelming military power, you remained chivalrous, for which even your most fervent of enemies respected you. The Ayyubid dynasty lasted long after your death, defeating all those who wished to take her land for centuries before finally succumbing to threats from within. =

Oh great Saladin, your people look to you to rebuild the might of the Ayyubid dynasty. Can you once again strike fear into the hearts and minds of your enemies with but a whisper of your name?

Welcome, O divine Montezuma! We grovel in awe at your magnificence! May the heaven shower all manner of good things upon you all the days of your life! Your are the leader of the mighty Aztec people, wandering nomads from a lost home in the north who in the 12th century came to live in the mesa central in the heart of what would come to be call Mexico. Surrounded by many tribes fighting to control the rich land surrounding the sacred lakes of Texoco, Xaltocan and Zampango. Through cunning alliances and martial prowess, within a mere two hundred years, the Aztecs came to dominate the Central American basin, ruling a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea. But the empire fell soon under the assault of the accursed Spaniards, wielding fiendish weapons the likes of which your faithful warriors had never seen. =

May the blessings of heaven be upon you, O great Nebuchadnezzar, father of mighty and ancient Babylon! Young was the world when Sargon built Babylon some five thousand years ago, long did it grow and prosper, gaining its first empire the eighteenth century BC, under godlike Hammurabi, the giver of law. Although conquered by the Kassites and then by the Assyrians, Babylon endured, emerging phoenix-like from its ashes of destruction and regaining its independence despite its many enemies. Truly was Babylon the center of arts and learning in the ancient world. O Nebuchadnezzar, your empire endured but a short time after your death, falling to the mighty Persians, and then to the Greeks, until the great city was destroyed by 141 BC. =

Honor and glory be yours, Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, Marshal of Finland. Your nation lies in the vast, cold North, surrounded by the great wilderness of forests and thousands of lakes. After being under the rule first of the Swedish and then of the Russians, Finland declared its independence in 1917 but was soon embroiled in a bloody civil war. Two decades later you united your war-torn nation to protect its independence against overwhelming Soviet attack. Despite all the odds, Finland remained independent in the torments of World War II by its stalwart united spirit, and from ashes of war your small agrarian country developed into a modern industrious welfare state the quality of life of which now stands on the top of the world. =

Hail to Charles the Great, first Emperor since the Fall of Rome, father of a kingdom that encompassed France, Germany, Italy and much of Eastern Europe. Legends of your conquests are pervasive throughout history, and you are without no doubts one of the greatest figureheads of history. The world has known you as both a highly religious man and a philanthropist. You often built friendly relationships with other countries, such as Egypt and India, so that you could later send money in an effort to assist struggling Christians in those regions. Although much more of a conqueror than an economic or social reformer, you have always helped the poor and sick in your kingdom. Despite being unable to write well yourself, you had a vast love of literature and education. Due to your conquests contacts with many different cultures and learning institutions, your era is became known as the Carolingian Renaissance, with a blossoming of the arts and sciences. =

Hail Alaric, King of the Visigoths, Sacker of Rome! Your people shout your name and raise their swords to you! From the shores of Scandinavia your people came and spread across Europe. In the East, the Ostrogoths successfully revolted against the Huns. In the West, the Visigoths conquered Iberia. Even the eternal city fell before your might in 410 BCE, marking the definitive decline of the Western Roman Empire! Yet, you also possessed the heart and wisdom of a true leader: you forced the senate to free the slaves and treated her citizens with kindness, and paid homage to their gods and let all worship as they might. However - divided, conquered, forgotten - the legacy of the Goths has faded with the passage of time. =

For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, horever, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and thought a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological supeiority, they conquered your fragmented nation.

Few can boast your patriotism and commitment to the cause of a Free Ireland, Commander Collins. Though you came from the humblest of beginnings, you truly embodied the pride of Irishness. It was not long before you joined the struggle for Home Rule, and you began to build a reputation for yourself – one of dedication, devotion, and pride for Ireland. After the Easter Rising turned bloody, you managed to turn a beaten movement into a potent physical force, one that would successfully found an Irish nation, fight a war for liberation, and win independence. Some did not share your view, however, and soon this incomplete nation descended once more into war. And though you paid the ultimate cost in the subsequent civil war, you gave your life for a free state that was established soon after. =

Greetings, noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations! Long have your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario in the land that has come to be known as the New York state in North America. In the mists of antiquity, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida united into one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. With no written language, the wise men of your nation created the great law of peace, the model for many contitutions including that of the United States. For many years, your people battled great enemies, such as the Huron, and the French and English invaders. Tought outnumbered and facing weapons far more advanced than the ones your warriors wielded, the Iroquois survived and prospered, until they were finally overwhelmed by the mighty armies of the new United States. =

May the Lord God bless you, honorable King David, leader of a secular nation called Israel. You succeeded in truly unifying the Israelite tribes, and set up a monarchical government, the first to ever embrace Judaism. Embarked on successful military campaigns against Israel's enemies, you defeated nearby regional entities such as the Philistines, thus creating secure borders for your kingdom. Under your holy guidance, Israel grew into a regional power. Under your House, the united Kingdom of Israel achieved prosperity and superiority over its neighbours. The prosperity of your kingdom would continue under your wise son Solomon. =

Grim days await you, Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy. Coming to the throne upon the assassination of your father, Italy would soon be plunged into the calamity of the First World War. Heeding to the popular will, you rallied the Italian forces against the forward march of Vienna, taking to the front with your queen to dispense both moral and medical support. But though victorious, Italy's losses would be too great, and the road would for paved for the country's next great threat: Benito Mussolini and his fascism. Luckily, his shadow that loomed upon you and your beautiful nation would not last forever, and soon you indirectly paved the way for a new Italy, one that would seek cooperation with its neighbours instead of competition driven by the culture of the Rinascimento of many centuries ago. =

Greetings to you, resourceful Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi. You are the founder of the mighty Kilwa Sultanate, a proud people of the sea. You purchased the island which would become your capital for mere cloth after your unlawful ostracism at the hands of your brothers, and built it into a proud city, the envy of the known world. From this new capital, your people, proud traders by nature, travelled the length of the African coast, spreading the influence of your sultanate. The Kilwa are a tolerant people, indeed those cities under your rule feature many separate beliefs, languages and peoples - a venerable melting pot of cultures which together forged the identity of the Swahili people who to this day occupy the lands of your former sultanate. = 
 # Requires translation!
The empire lasted long after your death, with your descendants ruling for many more centuries, expanding the rule of the Kilwa Sultanate far and wide, falling only to an invasion of superior weaponry at the hands of European colonials. Yet none could compare to you, wise leader. Your people call for you to lead them to greatness across the seas. Will you answer their call? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =

After years of strife at the hands of your neighboring rivals, you struck back at the enemies of your people, sacrificing their leaders in retribution for the insults dealt to your predecessors. The glory of Palenque was restored only by the guidance afforded by your wisdom, as you orchestrated vast reconstruction efforts within the city, creating some of the greatest monuments and architecture your people - and the world - have ever known. =

Your people greet you with a thunderous applause, oh Benito Juárez, overthrower of an empire and leader of the esteemed Mexican Republic! Mexico has a rich history, for its culture is nearly as diverse as its people are. The fertile land itself is ancient and has played host to a myriad of flourishing civilizations - such as the mighty Aztecs, the Maya, the Olmecs, Toltecs, Mixtecs and the Zapotecs. But it was all changed in the 1500s, when, with power and greed, the Spaniards arrived and began their bloody conquest of the New World. After 300 years of colonization, and having adopted the language, culture and systems of the Spaniards, the people rose up and ousted their former masters. This new, empowered Mexican nation was now the center of attention on the world's stage. The following hundred years were full of ideologies, muralism, foreign invasion and revolution that solidified the feeling of valiant resilience that all Mexicans hold dear to this day. =

Greetings, o great Temujin, immortal emperor of the mighty Mongol Empire! Your fists shatter walls of cities and your voice brings despair to your enemies. O Khan! You united the warring tribes of Northern Asia into a mighty people, creating the greatest cavalry force the world has ever witnessed.

As the first ever Queen regnant of Portugal, it was your wise stewardship that protected the royal court from the incursions of Napoleon, establishing a safe haven in Brazil to preserve the integrity of Portuguese rule. Despite struggling with illness throughout your reign, your effort to ensure Portugal's close cooperation with Brazil are credited with helping that state gain its eventual independence - and for this you will always be admired and respected by the people of both nations. = 祝福你，最仁慈的玛丽亚女王，葡萄牙人民的保护者和君主。作为葡萄牙有史以来第一位摄政王后，正是您的英明管理保护了王室免受拿破仑的入侵，在巴西建立了一个安全的避风港，以维护葡萄牙统治的完整性。尽管您在整个统治期间都在与疾病作斗争，但您为确保葡萄牙与巴西的密切合作所做的努力被认为有助于该国获得最终的独立。
Oh noble and pious queen, will you once again guide the kingdom of Portugal in the spirit of cooperation and prosperity? Will you establish a new legacy, one that will surpass all those who come before you? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? = 哦，高贵而虔诚的女王，你会再次以合作和繁荣的精神指导葡萄牙王国吗？你会建立一个新的遗产，一个将超越所有前辈的遗产吗？你能建立一个经得起时间考验的文明吗?

The blessings of the gods be upon you, Caesar Augustus, emperor of Rome and all her holdings. Your empire was the greatest and longest lived of all in Western civilization. And your people single handedly shaped its culture, law, art, and warfare like none other, before or since. Through years of glorious conquest, Rome came to dominate all the lands of the Mediterranean from Spain in the west to Syria in the east. And her dominion would eventually expand to cover much of England and northern Germany. Roman art and architecture still awe and inspire the world. And she remains the envy of all lesser civilizations who have followed. =

You are the ruler of Siam, an ancient country in the heart of Southeast Asia, a beautiful and mysterious land. Surrounded by foes, beset by bloody war and grinding poverty, the clever and loyal Siamese people have endured and trumphed. King Ramkhamhaeng, your empire was once part of the Khmer Empire, until the 13th century AD, when your ancestors revolted, forming the small Sukhothai kingdom. Through successful battle and cunning diplomacy, the tiny kingdom grew into a mighty empire, an empire which would dominate South East Asia for more than a century! =

Proud Sitting Bull, Chief of the Hunkpapa Lakota, the Seven Council Fires gather to listen and honour your wisdom. Seasoned hunters, the Sioux followed the buffalo from the shores of Lake Superior to the Black Hills of the western Dakotas. With the introduction of the horse, they became fearless warriors, dominating the Great Plains and driving back the Kiowa and Pawnee. Your existance marked the peak of the united tribes led by you, for it crossed the borders of reservation, the symbol of tyranny and humiliation, and defeated the Americans under Little Bighorn, sending a message of liberty and freedom to the world. Alas, your people were fighting a losing battle, for the United States had grown too big, too fast. In just a few short years, even the promised reservations were reduced to mere fractions of their original size, and eventually you yourself fell victim of an assasination at the hands of the white man. Yet, the Sioux legacy survived and your people finally won their rights, inspired by your courage. =

Most insightful and cunning Doge, Venice once again requires the service of a skilled leader, one who can bring the republic back to the forefront of world affairs. Can you establish your nation through careful trade, or will you work to conquer your enemies through diplomacy? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? = 威尼斯最有见地和狡猾的总督再次需要一个熟练的领导人的服务，一个能够将共和国带回世界事务前沿的人。你能通过谨慎的贸易建立你的国家，还是通过外交来征服你的敌人？你能建立一个经得起时间考验的文明吗?

Mighty Sargon the Great of Akkad, we prostrate ourselves before you! You are the Emperor of the Akkadians, the greatest people to ever arise along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. From its founding around 2300 BCE, Akkad spread its dominion through a force like none of which the ancient world had ever seen, which marked, among other things, history's first standing army. Ranging from the Tarsus Mountsins to the Persian Gulf, the mighty Akkadian empire was a force to be reckoned with. Yet, you were much better than a mere warmonger, because your rule oversaw the flourishing of trade cross all of the Middle East, extending all the way to the cities of Greece. Although the curses of war and famine tore your kingdom apart after centuries of prosperity, Mesopotamia was once again transformed into a land of culture and color as the ever-growing wealth of Akkad heralded a time of peace in the forever restless realm. =

Blessings of God be upon you oh great caliph Harun al-Rashid, leader of the pious Arabian people! The Muslim empire, the Caliphate was born in the turbulent years after the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, as his followers sought to extend the rule of God to all of the people of the earth. The caliphate grew mighty indeed at the height of its power, ruling Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Anatolia, the Balkans and Persia. An empire as great as or even greater than that of Rome. The arts and sciences flourished in Arabia during the Middle Ages, even as the countries of Europe descended into ignorance and chaos.

Salutations, Eva Perón, spiritual leader of the Argentinian nation and wife to Juan Perón. Yours is the second largest country in Latin America, and its name has derived from the rumors of the existence of silver mountains; what is certainly rich is history in both pre-columbian and republican eras. With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat deal with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of their European roots, they deeply linked the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; and because of their condition of colonials, they link themselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies the people, feeling somehow the vocation of the Patria Grande San Martín and Bolívar once imagined. =

Welcome, O magnificent and enlightened King Tiridates III, descendant of the great and ancient Kingship of Armenia. Your country's history stretches far back, its origins tracing from the northernmost satrapies of the mighty Achaemenid Dynasty. For centuries, the Kingdom lay at the crossroads of power, between the two empires of Rome in the West and Parthinia in the East, who would wage bloody war for the right to subjugate her beneath them. In the 3rd century AD, the throne of Armenian Kings would fall to the occupation of the Sassanid Persians, successors of Parthia, but, with the aid of the Roman Emperor Aurelian, it would be restored unto you, Armenia's rightful King. And as her King, you would go on to proclaim Armenia's devotion as the first Christian state in the world, several dozen years prior the proclamation of Constantine the Great. = 
 # Requires translation!
Wise Prince, the Kingdom of Armenia must rise once more, and with it must come the defense of the faith that you would call your own.

Greetings, most wise and prudent Henry Parker, father of the Australian Federation. Australia truly is a unique and ancient land, more so than any other, for its lands abound in nature's gifts and its shores have beckoned, welcomed, and harbored immigrants from afar for over 50,000 years. By the time you arrived in Sydney as an English immigrant in 1839, Australia was divided into thriving British colonies of undeniably vital significance. By 1889, as premier you had led the colony of New South Wales five times to achieve many great things that undoubtedly improved the lives of many. You will always be remembered, however, in the hearts of Australians, for being instrumental in the process of federating the Australian colonies into a single united nation, earning you the humble title of "The father of the Australian Federation". Thanks to your efforts, Australia today remains one of the most wealthy, prosperous, and modern countries in the developed world, and truly a sight to behold. =

Noble and virtuous Queen Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Austria, the people bow to your gracious will. Following the death of your father King Charles VI, you ascended the thone of Austria during a time of great instability, but the empty coffers and diminished military did litle to dissuade your ambitions. Faced with war almost immediately upon your succession to the thron, you managed to fend off your foes, and in naming your husband Francis Stephen co-ruler, assured your place as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. During your reigh, you guided Austria on a new path of reform - strengthening the military, replenishing the treasury, and improving the educational system of the kingdom. =

It was under your leadership that combined Muslim armies defeated the ambitious Crusaders of Europe in a series of victories in which you overcame overwhelming odds in order to prevail. None could stand against you, and your forces became pivotal in driving the Christians out of the Holy Land once more. From your stronghold of Cairo, you established the Ayyubid dynasty, one which would come to rule vast swathes of land, from Tunisia in the west to Mesopotamia in the East and Nubia in the South. Despite your overwhelming military power, you remained chivalrous, for which even your most fervent of enemies respected you. The Ayyubid dynasty lasted long after your death, defeating all those who wished to take her land for centuries before finally succumbing to threats from within. =

Eternal glory and praise for you, fierce and vengeful Warrior Queen! In a time dominated by men, you not only secured your throne and sovereign rule, but also successfully defied the power of the Roman Empire. After suffering terrible punishment and humiliation at the hand of the Roman invaders, you rallied your people in a bloody and terrifying revolt. Legions fell under your chariot wheels and the city of London burned. While in the end the Romans retained ownership of the isles, you alone made Nero consider withdrawing all troops and leaving Briton forever. =

Hail Alaric, King of the Visigoths, Sacker of Rome! Your people shout your name and raise their swords to you! From the shores of Scandinavia your people came and spread across Europe. In the East, the Ostrogoths successfully revolted against the Huns. In the West, the Visigoths conquered Iberia. Even the eternal city fell before your might in 410 BCE, marking the definitive decline of the Western Roman Empire! Yet, you also possessed the heart and wisdom of a true leader: you forced the senate to free the slaves and treated her citizens with kindness, and paid homage to their gods and let all worship as they might. However - divided, conquered, forgotten - the legacy of the Goths has faded with the passage of time. =

Your men stand proudly to greet you, Great Attila, grand warrior and ruler of the Hunnic empire. Together with your brother Bleda you expanded the boundaries of your empire, becoming the most powerful and frightening force of the 5th century. You bowed the Eastern Roman Emperors to your will and took kingdom after kingdom along the Danube and Nisava Rivers. As the sovereign ruler of the Huns, you marched your army across Europe into Gaul, planning to extend your already impressive lands all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. Your untimely death led to the quick disintegration and downfall of your empire, but your name and deeds have created an everlasting legacy for your people. =

Fearsome General, your people call for the recreation of a new Hunnic Empire, one which will make the exploits and histories of the former seem like the faded dreaming of a dying sun.

Greetings, President Mahatma Gandhi, great souled leader of India! You are the ruler of one of the oldest countries in the world with history stretching back almost 10'000 years. A spiritual country, India is the birthplace of three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. This is a passionate land of music and color, a land of great wealth and grinding poverty. For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, horever, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and thought a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological supeiority, they conquered your fragmented nation. England remained in power for some two centuries until driven out by a rising wave of Indian nationalism, a peaceful rebellion unlike any before seen in history, one led by you! =

Few can boast your patriotism and commitment to the cause of a Free Ireland, Commander Collins. Though you came from the humblest of beginnings, you truly embodied the pride of Irishness. It was not long before you joined the struggle for Home Rule, and you began to build a reputation for yourself – one of dedication, devotion, and pride for Ireland. After the Easter Rising turned bloody, you managed to turn a beaten movement into a potent physical force, one that would successfully found an Irish nation, fight a war for liberation, and win independence. Some did not share your view, however, and soon this incomplete nation descended once more into war. And though you paid the ultimate cost in the subsequent civil war, you gave your life for a free state that was established soon after. =

Greetings, noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations! Long have your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario in the land that has come to be known as the New York state in North America. In the mists of antiquity, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida united into one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. With no written language, the wise men of your nation created the great law of peace, the model for many contitutions including that of the United States. For many years, your people battled great enemies, such as the Huron, and the French and English invaders. Tought outnumbered and facing weapons far more advanced than the ones your warriors wielded, the Iroquois survived and prospered, until they were finally overwhelmed by the mighty armies of the new United States. =

Greetings to you, resourceful Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi. You are the founder of the mighty Kilwa Sultanate, a proud people of the sea. You purchased the island which would become your capital for mere cloth after your unlawful ostracism at the hands of your brothers, and built it into a proud city, the envy of the known world. From this new capital, your people, proud traders by nature, travelled the length of the African coast, spreading the influence of your sultanate. The Kilwa are a tolerant people, indeed those cities under your rule feature many separate beliefs, languages and peoples - a venerable melting pot of cultures which together forged the identity of the Swahili people who to this day occupy the lands of your former sultanate. = 
 # Requires translation!
The empire lasted long after your death, with your descendants ruling for many more centuries, expanding the rule of the Kilwa Sultanate far and wide, falling only to an invasion of superior weaponry at the hands of European colonials.

Greetings to you, exalted King Sejong the Great, servant to the people and protector of the Choson Dynasty! Your glorious vision of prosperity and overwhelming benevolence towards the common man made you the most beloved of all Korean kings. From the earliest days of your reign, the effort you took to provide a fair and just society for all was surpassed only by the technological advances spurred onwards by your unquenched thirst for knowledge. Guided by your wisdom, the scholars of the Jade Hall developed Korea's first written language, Hangul, bringing the light of literature and science to the masses after centuries of literary darkness. =

Honorable Sejong, once more the people look to your for guidance. Will you rise to the occasion, bringing harmony and understanding to the people? Can you once again advance your kingdom's standing to such wondrous heights? Can you build a civilization that stands the test of time? =

Blessings be upon you, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Vytautas the Great. It was your majesty that defeated the Golden Horde, ending forever the Mongol's ambitions about Europe. The Lithuanian Empire survived two centuries of the religious crusades, lead by the Teutonic order, finally striking down her great rival at the Battle of Žalgiris. The Duchy officially adopted Christianity with the Union of Krewo, signed by your traitorous brother Jogaila in 1386. Despite losing political and cultural solidarity, Lithuania was finally restored to sovereignity in the twentieth century. =

May the blessings of the gods be upon you, oh great king Alexander, son of Zeus! You rule the great Kingdom of Macedon, the most powerful empire in the world! In a mere fraction of a lifetime, you led your armies to victory upon victory, destroyed the villainous Persians, and in the process forged an empire from Illyria to the Indus Valley. Art and literature, phulosophy and science, all flourished within your kingdom, spreading the Hellenic culture across the known world.

Your people greet you with a thunderous applause, oh Benito Juárez, overthrower of an empire and leader of the esteemed Mexican Republic! Mexico has a rich history, for its culture is nearly as diverse as its people are. The fertile land itself is ancient and has played host to a myriad of flourishing civilizations - such as the mighty Aztecs, the Maya, the Olmecs, Toltecs, Mixtecs and the Zapotecs. But it was all changed in the 1500s, when, with power and greed, the Spaniards arrived and began their bloody conquest of the New World. After 300 years of colonization, and having adopted the language, culture and systems of the Spaniards, the people rose up and ousted their former masters. This new, empowered Mexican nation was now the center of attention on the world's stage. The following hundred years were full of ideologies, muralism, foreign invasion and revolution that solidified the feeling of valiant resilience that all Mexicans hold dear to this day. =

Hail stalwart Prince William of Orange, liberator of the Netherlands and hero to the Dutch people.

You gave your life to the rebellion, falling at the hands of an assassin in 1584, but your death would only serve to embolden the people's charge, and your legacy as 'Father of the Fatherland' will stand as a symbol of Dutch independence for all time. =

Hail to thee, great Duke William of Normandy! Your people are a proud and noble race; hailing from their beginnings as Viking warriors, the Normans quickly established themselves as a persevering and formidable culture. Taking for themselves a land of their own in France, the Normans would spread their martial and cultural influence across Europe and the Mediterranean. With conquests in Southern Italy, Northern Africa, and the Levant, the might and piety of the Normans would know no match and, with you, Duke, at its stead, history would weave Normandy's boldest claim; for that of the throne of England, of which it would take, and change forever. =

Blessings of God be upon you, oh Great Emperor Suleiman! Your power, wealth and generosity awe the world! Truly, are you called 'Magnificent!' Your empire began in Bithynia, a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century. Taking advantage in the decline of the great Selkuj Sultanate of Rum, King Osman I of Bithynia expanded west into Anatolia. Over the next century, your subjects brought down the empire of Byzantium, taking its holdings in Turkey and then the Balkans. In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans captured ancient Constantinople, gaining control of the strategic link between Europe and the Middle East. Your people's empire would continue to expand for centuries governing much of North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height. =

Proud Sitting Bull, Chief of the Hunkpapa Lakota, the Seven Council Fires gather to listen and honour your wisdom. Seasoned hunters, the Sioux followed the buffalo from the shores of Lake Superior to the Black Hills of the western Dakotas. With the introduction of the horse, they became fearless warriors, dominating the Great Plains and driving back the Kiowa and Pawnee. Your existance marked the peak of the united tribes led by you, for it crossed the borders of reservation, the symbol of tyranny and humiliation, and defeated the Americans under Little Bighorn, sending a message of liberty and freedom to the world. Alas, your people were fighting a losing battle, for the United States had grown too big, too fast. In just a few short years, even the promised reservations were reduced to mere fractions of their original size, and eventually you yourself fell victim of an assasination at the hands of the white man. Yet, the Sioux legacy survived and your people finally won their rights, inspired by your courage. =

Itancan, your enemies have sold your lands and slaughtered the buffalo, but the Great Spirit has allowed you to lead your people once again, as your courage and guidance are needed once more.

May the blessings of God, who is greatest of all, be upon you Askia, leader of the Songhai people! For many years your kingdom was a vassal of the mighty West African state of Mali, until the middle of the 14th century, when King Sunni Ali Ber wrested independence from the Mali, conquering much territory and fighting off numerous foes who sought to destroy him. Ultimately, his conquest of the wealthy cities of Timbuktu and Jenne gave the growing Songhai empire the economic power to survive for some 100 years, until the empire was destroyed by foes with advanced technology - muskets against spearmen. =

Greetings, most astute Doge Enrico Dandolo of Venice, master of statecraft and shrewd negotiator.

Your role in guiding the Crusaders during the sacking of Constantinople led to an even greater expansion of your power, and secured your legacy throughout history. =

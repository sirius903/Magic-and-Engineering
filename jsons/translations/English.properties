Mighty Sargon the Great of Akkad, we prostrate ourselves before you! You are the Emperor of the Akkadians, the greatest people to ever arise along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. From its founding around 2300 BCE, Akkad spread its dominion through a force like none of which the ancient world had ever seen, which marked, among other things, history's first standing army. Ranging from the Tarsus Mountsins to the Persian Gulf, the mighty Akkadian empire was a force to be reckoned with. Yet, you were much better than a mere warmonger, because your rule oversaw the flourishing of trade cross all of the Middle East, extending all the way to the cities of Greece. Although the curses of war and famine tore your kingdom apart after centuries of prosperity, Mesopotamia was once again transformed into a land of culture and color as the ever-growing wealth of Akkad heralded a time of peace in the forever restless realm. =

Salutations, Eva Perón, spiritual leader of the Argentinian nation and wife to Juan Perón. Yours is the second largest country in Latin America, and its name has derived from the rumors of the existence of silver mountains; what is certainly rich is history in both pre-columbian and republican eras. With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat deal with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of their European roots, they deeply linked the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; and because of their condition of colonials, they link themselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies the people, feeling somehow the vocation of the Patria Grande San Martín and Bolívar once imagined. =

Welcome, O magnificent and enlightened King Tiridates III, descendant of the great and ancient Kingship of Armenia. Your country's history stretches far back, its origins tracing from the northernmost satrapies of the mighty Achaemenid Dynasty. For centuries, the Kingdom lay at the crossroads of power, between the two empires of Rome in the West and Parthinia in the East, who would wage bloody war for the right to subjugate her beneath them. In the 3rd century AD, the throne of Armenian Kings would fall to the occupation of the Sassanid Persians, successors of Parthia, but, with the aid of the Roman Emperor Aurelian, it would be restored unto you, Armenia's rightful King. And as her King, you would go on to proclaim Armenia's devotion as the first Christian state in the world, several dozen years prior the proclamation of Constantine the Great. =

Wise Prince, the Kingdom of Armenia must rise once more, and with it must come the defense of the faith that you would call your own.

Greetings, most wise and prudent Henry Parker, father of the Australian Federation. Australia truly is a unique and ancient land, more so than any other, for its lands abound in nature's gifts and its shores have beckoned, welcomed, and harbored immigrants from afar for over 50,000 years. By the time you arrived in Sydney as an English immigrant in 1839, Australia was divided into thriving British colonies of undeniably vital significance. By 1889, as premier you had led the colony of New South Wales five times to achieve many great things that undoubtedly improved the lives of many. You will always be remembered, however, in the hearts of Australians, for being instrumental in the process of federating the Australian colonies into a single united nation, earning you the humble title of "The father of the Australian Federation". Thanks to your efforts, Australia today remains one of the most wealthy, prosperous, and modern countries in the developed world, and truly a sight to behold. =

Noble and virtuous Queen Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Austria, the people bow to your gracious will. Following the death of your father King Charles VI, you ascended the thone of Austria during a time of great instability, but the empty coffers and diminished military did litle to dissuade your ambitions. Faced with war almost immediately upon your succession to the thron, you managed to fend off your foes, and in naming your husband Francis Stephen co-ruler, assured your place as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. During your reigh, you guided Austria on a new path of reform - strengthening the military, replenishing the treasury, and improving the educational system of the kingdom. =

Peace and blessings be upon you, oh great Saladin! From humble beginnings in a Kurdish family, your upbringing in Damascus saw you excel in all which you took part in. It was under your leadership that combined Muslim armies defeated the ambitious Crusaders of Europe in a series of victories in which you overcame overwhelming odds in order to prevail. None could stand against you, and your forces became pivotal in driving the Christians out of the Holy Land once more. From your stronghold of Cairo, you established the Ayyubid dynasty, one which would come to rule vast swathes of land, from Tunisia in the west to Mesopotamia in the East and Nubia in the South. Despite your overwhelming military power, you remained chivalrous, for which even your most fervent of enemies respected you. The Ayyubid dynasty lasted long after your death, defeating all those who wished to take her land for centuries before finally succumbing to threats from within. =

Greetings, and may God be with you, President Paul Kruger, leader of the Boer people!

Following the annexation of Transvaal by the British Empire, you lead a resistance movement, leading to the First Boer War.

All hail the most magnificent and magnanimous Empress Theodora, beloved of Byzantium and of Rome! From the lowly ranks of actress and courtesan you became the most powerful woman in the Roman Empire, consort to Justinian I. Starting in the late 520's AD, you joined your husband in a series of important spiritual and legal reforms, creating many laws which elevated the status of and promoted equal treatment of women in the empire. You also aided in the restoration and construction of many aqueducts, bridges and churches across Constantinople, culminating in the creation of the Hagia Sophia, one of the most splendid architectural wonders of the world. = 
 # Requires translation!
Beautiful Empress, Byzantium is in need of your wisdom and strength - her people are lost without your light to lead them. The Byzantine Empire may have fallen once, but its spirit is still intact waiting to be reborn anew. Can you return Byzantium to the heights of glory it once enjoyed? Can you create a civilization to stand the test of time? =

Blessings and salutations to you, revered Queen Dido, founder of the legendary kingdom of Carthage.

Fearing the lengths from which your brother would pursue this vast wealth, you and your compatriots sailed for new lands. Arriving on the shores of North Africa, you tricked the local king with the simple manipulation of an ox hide, laying out a vast expanse of territory for your new home, the future kingdom of Carthage. =

Honor and glory be yours, Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, Marshal of Finland. Your nation lies in the vast, cold North, surrounded by the great wilderness of forests and thousands of lakes. After being under the rule first of the Swedish and then of the Russians, Finland declared its independence in 1917 but was soon embroiled in a bloody civil war. Two decades later you united your war-torn nation to protect its independence against overwhelming Soviet attack. Despite all the odds, Finland remained independent in the torments of World War II by its stalwart united spirit, and from ashes of war your small agrarian country developed into a modern industrious welfare state the quality of life of which now stands on the top of the world. =

Hail to Charles the Great, first Emperor since the Fall of Rome, father of a kingdom that encompassed France, Germany, Italy and much of Eastern Europe.

The world has known you as both a highly religious man and a philanthropist. You often built friendly relationships with other countries, such as Egypt and India, so that you could later send money in an effort to assist struggling Christians in those regions. Although much more of a conqueror than an economic or social reformer, you have always helped the poor and sick in your kingdom. Despite being unable to write well yourself, you had a vast love of literature and education. Due to your conquests contacts with many different cultures and learning institutions, your era is became known as the Carolingian Renaissance, with a blossoming of the arts and sciences. =

Hail Alaric, King of the Visigoths, Sacker of Rome! Your people shout your name and raise their swords to you! From the shores of Scandinavia your people came and spread across Europe. In the East, the Ostrogoths successfully revolted against the Huns. In the West, the Visigoths conquered Iberia. Even the eternal city fell before your might in 410 BCE, marking the definitive decline of the Western Roman Empire! Yet, you also possessed the heart and wisdom of a true leader: you forced the senate to free the slaves and treated her citizens with kindness, and paid homage to their gods and let all worship as they might. However - divided, conquered, forgotten - the legacy of the Goths has faded with the passage of time. =

You bowed the Eastern Roman Emperors to your will and took kingdom after kingdom along the Danube and Nisava Rivers. As the sovereign ruler of the Huns, you marched your army across Europe into Gaul, planning to extend your already impressive lands all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. Your untimely death led to the quick disintegration and downfall of your empire, but your name and deeds have created an everlasting legacy for your people. =

Fearsome General, your people call for the recreation of a new Hunnic Empire, one which will make the exploits and histories of the former seem like the faded dreaming of a dying sun. Will you answer their call to regain your rightful prominence and glory? Will mount your steadfast steed and lead your armies to victory? Will you build a civilization that stands the test of time? =

Greetings, President Mahatma Gandhi, great souled leader of India! You are the ruler of one of the oldest countries in the world with history stretching back almost 10'000 years. A spiritual country, India is the birthplace of three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. This is a passionate land of music and color, a land of great wealth and grinding poverty. For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, horever, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and thought a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological supeiority, they conquered your fragmented nation. England remained in power for some two centuries until driven out by a rising wave of Indian nationalism, a peaceful rebellion unlike any before seen in history, one led by you! =

Few can boast your patriotism and commitment to the cause of a Free Ireland, Commander Collins. Though you came from the humblest of beginnings, you truly embodied the pride of Irishness. It was not long before you joined the struggle for Home Rule, and you began to build a reputation for yourself – one of dedication, devotion, and pride for Ireland. After the Easter Rising turned bloody, you managed to turn a beaten movement into a potent physical force, one that would successfully found an Irish nation, fight a war for liberation, and win independence. Some did not share your view, however, and soon this incomplete nation descended once more into war. And though you paid the ultimate cost in the subsequent civil war, you gave your life for a free state that was established soon after. =

With no written language, the wise men of your nation created the great law of peace, the model for many contitutions including that of the United States. For many years, your people battled great enemies, such as the Huron, and the French and English invaders. Tought outnumbered and facing weapons far more advanced than the ones your warriors wielded, the Iroquois survived and prospered, until they were finally overwhelmed by the mighty armies of the new United States. =

Great Suryavarman, Emperor of the Khmer, the one who has entered the heavenly world of Vishnu, we kneel blinded by your glory! You reunited a divided empire and made it stronger than ever before, expanding its borders to the west and north and reaching the present-day peninsular Malaysia. Merciless to enemies, kind to friends, you established good relations with China, creating new important trade routes. You innovated the arts and architecture of the empire, and even gave the order to build the legendary Angkor Wat, the largest temple in the known world! In the end, your empire collapsed below its own greatness long before the Europeans managed to create their "civilizations", and yet history remembers you as a warrior, diplomat, artist and religious man. =

Mighty King, your people need you once more, for only you are capable to lead them to even greater glory and fame, bringing back the glory of Angkor!

Greetings to you, resourceful Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi. You are the founder of the mighty Kilwa Sultanate, a proud people of the sea. You purchased the island which would become your capital for mere cloth after your unlawful ostracism at the hands of your brothers, and built it into a proud city, the envy of the known world. From this new capital, your people, proud traders by nature, travelled the length of the African coast, spreading the influence of your sultanate. The Kilwa are a tolerant people, indeed those cities under your rule feature many separate beliefs, languages and peoples - a venerable melting pot of cultures which together forged the identity of the Swahili people who to this day occupy the lands of your former sultanate. = 
 # Requires translation!
The empire lasted long after your death, with your descendants ruling for many more centuries, expanding the rule of the Kilwa Sultanate far and wide, falling only to an invasion of superior weaponry at the hands of European colonials. Yet none could compare to you, wise leader. Your people call for you to lead them to greatness across the seas. Will you answer their call? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =

Hail to you, brave Mvemba a Nzinga, Queen of the Ndongo and Matamba, whose beauty is matched only by your cunning.

You defied tradition by claiming two thrones and are remembered for standing bravely against the onslaught of European imperialism. When the Portuguese invaded your lands, you escaped death and shrewdly manipulated the Dutch into sending you aid. Together you turned back the army of the Portuguese at the Battle of Kombi. Yet, ever faced with threats both inside and out, the never-ending war took its tool, and in the end not even your bravery could stop the march of foreign crowns. =

The Duchy officially adopted Christianity with the Union of Krewo, signed by your traitorous brother Jogaila in 1386. Despite losing political and cultural solidarity, Lithuania was finally restored to sovereignity in the twentieth century. =

Your people greet you with a thunderous applause, oh Benito Juárez, overthrower of an empire and leader of the esteemed Mexican Republic! Mexico has a rich history, for its culture is nearly as diverse as its people are. The fertile land itself is ancient and has played host to a myriad of flourishing civilizations - such as the mighty Aztecs, the Maya, the Olmecs, Toltecs, Mixtecs and the Zapotecs. But it was all changed in the 1500s, when, with power and greed, the Spaniards arrived and began their bloody conquest of the New World. After 300 years of colonization, and having adopted the language, culture and systems of the Spaniards, the people rose up and ousted their former masters. This new, empowered Mexican nation was now the center of attention on the world's stage. The following hundred years were full of ideologies, muralism, foreign invasion and revolution that solidified the feeling of valiant resilience that all Mexicans hold dear to this day. =

Noble Benito Juárez, from humble beginnings as a Zapotec native, you rose to lead this great country. It was you that resisted the French and restored the republic.

The blessings of heaven be upon you, beloved king Darius of Persia! You lead a strong and wise people. In the morning of the world, the great Persian leader Cyrus revolted against the mighty Median empire and by 550 BC, the Medes were no more. Through cunning diplomacy and military prowess, great Cyrus conquered wealthy Lydia and powerful Babylon. His son conquering proud Egypt some years later. Over time, Persian might expanded into far away Macedonia, at the very door of the upstart Greek city-states. Long would Persia prosper until the upstart villain Alexander of Macedon, destroyed the great empire in one shocking campaign. =

Greetings to you, Great King Ramkhamhaeng, leader of the glorious Siamese people! O mighty King, your people bow down before you in awe and fear! You are the ruler of Siam, an ancient country in the heart of Southeast Asia, a beautiful and mysterious land. Surrounded by foes, beset by bloody war and grinding poverty, the clever and loyal Siamese people have endured and trumphed. King Ramkhamhaeng, your empire was once part of the Khmer Empire, until the 13th century AD, when your ancestors revolted, forming the small Sukhothai kingdom. Through successful battle and cunning diplomacy, the tiny kingdom grew into a mighty empire, an empire which would dominate South East Asia for more than a century! =

Proud Sitting Bull, Chief of the Hunkpapa Lakota, the Seven Council Fires gather to listen and honour your wisdom. Seasoned hunters, the Sioux followed the buffalo from the shores of Lake Superior to the Black Hills of the western Dakotas. With the introduction of the horse, they became fearless warriors, dominating the Great Plains and driving back the Kiowa and Pawnee. Your existance marked the peak of the united tribes led by you, for it crossed the borders of reservation, the symbol of tyranny and humiliation, and defeated the Americans under Little Bighorn, sending a message of liberty and freedom to the world. Alas, your people were fighting a losing battle, for the United States had grown too big, too fast. In just a few short years, even the promised reservations were reduced to mere fractions of their original size, and eventually you yourself fell victim of an assasination at the hands of the white man. Yet, the Sioux legacy survived and your people finally won their rights, inspired by your courage. =

Itancan, your enemies have sold your lands and slaughtered the buffalo, but the Great Spirit has allowed you to lead your people once again, as your courage and guidance are needed once more.

Ultimately, his conquest of the wealthy cities of Timbuktu and Jenne gave the growing Songhai empire the economic power to survive for some 100 years, until the empire was destroyed by foes with advanced technology - muskets against spearmen. =

Greetings, most astute Doge Enrico Dandolo of Venice, master of statecraft and shrewd negotiator.

In aligning yourself with the Fourth Crusade, you carefully gained a strategic advantage and used the Crusaders to reacquire lost territory for Venice. Your role in guiding the Crusaders during the sacking of Constantinople led to an even greater expansion of your power, and secured your legacy throughout history. =
